"""
Approval Artifact - Cryptographic binding of approvals to execution plans.

This module provides tamper-proof approval artifacts that bind authorization
decisions to specific plan hashes. This ensures:
- Plans cannot be modified after approval
- Approvals are auditable and traceable
- Authorization scope is clearly defined

IMPORTANT: This is a security mechanism. All functions are pure and deterministic
(except timestamp generation in create_approval).

    Compute a deterministic SHA-256 hash of a plan.

    Uses JSON canonicalization to ensure the same plan always produces
    the same hash, regardless of key ordering or whitespace.

    Args:
        plan: The execution plan to hash

    Returns:
        Hex-encoded SHA-256 hash (64 characters)

    Example:

    Create an approval artifact for a plan.

    The approval artifact cryptographically binds authorization to a specific

        approved_by: Identifier of who/what approved (e.g., "policy", "user@example.com")
